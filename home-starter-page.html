      <h2>About Us</h2>
      <p>
        Openness, accountability, and honesty define government
        transparency. In a free society, transparency is government's
        obligation to share information with citizens. It is at the heart
        of how citizens hold their public officials accountable. Here at
        TGIF we believe that government should be transparent.
      </p>
      <p>
        Governments exist to serve the people. Information on how
        officials conduct the public business and spend taxpayer money
        must be readily available and easily understood. This transparency
        allows good and just governance. Transparency promotes
        accountability and provides information for citizens about what
        their Government is doing.
      </p>
      
            <p>
              We also believe that government should be participatory. Public
              engagement enhances the Government's effectiveness and improves
              the quality of its decisions. Knowledge is widely dispersed in
              society, and public officials benefit from having access to that
              dispersed knowledge. We invite you to use our site to become
              actively engaged in American government.
            </p>
            <p>
              TGIF works to disclose information in forms that the public can
              readily find and use. We solicit public feedback to identify
              information of greatest use to the public.
            </p>

          <h2>Background History of Government Transparency</h2>
          <p>
            In the West, the idea that government should be open to public scrutiny
            and susceptible to public opinion dates back at least to the time of the
            Enlightenment, when many philosophes made an attack on absolutist
            doctrine of state secrecy, a core part of their intellectual project.
            The passage of formal legislative instruments to this end can also be
            traced to this time with Sweden, for example, (which then included
            Finland as a Swedish-governed territory) enacting free press legislation
            as part of its constitution (Freedom of the Press Act, 1766). This
            approach, and that of the philosophes more broadly, is strongly related
            to recent historiography on the eighteenth-century public sphere.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            Influenced by Enlightenment thought, the revolutions in America (1776)
            and France (1789), freedom of the press enshrined provisions and
            requirements for public budgetary accounting and freedom of the press in
            constitutional articles. In the nineteenth century, attempts by
            Metternichean statesmen to row back on these measures were vigorously
            opposed by a number of eminent liberal politicians and writers, Bentham,
            Mill and Acton prominent among the latter.
          </p>
          <p>
            Open government is widely seen to be a key hallmark of contemporary
            democratic practice and is often linked to the passing of freedom of
            information legislation. Scandinavian countries claim to have adopted
            the first freedom of information legislation, dating the origins of its
            modern provisions to the eighteenth century and Finland continuing the
            presumption of openness after gaining independence in 1917, passing its
            Act on Publicity of Official Documents in 1951 (superseded by new
            legislation in 1999).
          </p>
          
          <p>
            The United States passed its Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) in 1966,
            FOIAs, Access to Information Acts (AIAs) or equivalent laws were passed
            in Denmark and Norway in 1970.
